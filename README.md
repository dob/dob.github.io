## Projects

### AuctionHouse

AuctionHouse is an decentralized application built on Ethereum for auctioning non-fungible, on-chain, items. Think of it like Ebay, but for unique on-blockchain items like tokens that represent domain names, tickets, jobs in on-chain economies. This was our first attempt at an end-to-end DApp, including smart contracts on Ethereum, a web frontend, and transaction signer/wallet integrations.
